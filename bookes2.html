            <p>
                Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness doing well with money isn?t necessarily about what you
                know. It?s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. How to
                manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of
                mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world,
                people don?t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a
                meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd
                incentives are scrambled together. In the psychology of money, the author shares 19 short stories
                exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of
                life?s most important matters.

        <br>
        how-bhagavad-gita-transformed-lifeThere is a common misconception among many people that Bhagavad Gita and
        Mahabharata belong to only those practicing the Hindu religion. The messages contained in the Bhagavad Gita are
        universally applicable to all, irrespective of their country or religion. It is not a religious scripture
        pertaining to a certain section of society. Bhagavad Gita teaches us the right way to lead our life. The very
        purpose of Bhagavad Gita is to deliver mankind from the sufferings of this world. Every man is in difficulty in
        so many ways, as Arjuna was in, having to fight the Battle of Kurukshetra.

        Bhagavad Gita is the essence of all Vedic knowledge and one of the most important Upanishads in Vedic
        literature. If one reads Bhagavad Gita regularly and attentively, he can surpass the study of all Vedic
        literature. Learn the

            This unusual autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth", is a window to the workings of Mahatma
            Gandhi's mind- a window to the emotions of his heart, a window to understanding what drove this seemingly
            ordinary man to the heights of being the father of a nation- India.
            Starting with his days as a boy, Gandhi takes one through his trials and turmoils and situations that
            moulded his philosophy of life- going through child marriage, his studies in England, practicing Law in
            South Africa- and his Satyagraha there- to the early beginnings of the Independence movement in India.
            He did not aim to write an autobiography but rather share the experience of his various experiments with
            truth to arrive at what he perceived as Absolute Truth- the ideal of his struggle against racism, violence
            and colonialism.

            This section is written by Mahadev Desai who translated the book from Gujarati to English. In this preface
            Desai notes that the book was originally published in two volumes, the first in 1927 and second in 1929. He
            also mentions that the original was priced at 1 rupee and had a run of five editions by the time of the
            writing of his preface. 50,000 copies had been sold in Gujarati but since the English edition was expensive
            it prevented Indians from purchasing it. Desai notes the need to bring out a cheaper English version. He
            also mentions that the translation has been revised by an English scholar who did not want his name to be
            published. Chapters XXIX–XLIII of Part V were translated by Desai's friend and colleague Pyarelal
            Nayyar.[14]

            He is one of the most beloved athletes in history and one of the most gifted men ever to step onto a tennis court – but from early childhood Andre Agassi hated the game.

            Coaxed to swing a racket while still in the crib, forced to hit hundreds of balls a day while still in grade school, Agassi resented the constant pressure even as he drove himself to become a prodigy, an inner conflict that would define him. Now, in his beautiful, haunting autobiography, Agassi tells the story of a life framed by such conflicts.
            
            Agassi makes us feel his panic as an undersized seven-year-old in Las Vegas, practicing all day under the obsessive gaze of his violent father. We see him at thirteen, banished to a Florida tennis camp. Lonely, scared, a ninth-grade dropout, he rebels in ways that will soon make him a 1980s icon. By the time he turns pro at sixteen, his new look promises to change tennis forever, as does his lightning fast return.
            
            And yet, despite his raw talent, he struggles early on. We feel his confusion as he loses to the world's best, his greater confusion as he starts to win. After stumbling in three Grand Slam finals, Agassi shocks the world, and himself, by capturing the 1992 Wimbledon. Overnight he becomes a fan favorite and a media target.
            
            Agassi brings a near-photographic memory to every pivotal match, and every public relationship. Alongside vivid portraits of rivals, Agassi gives unstinting accounts of his brief time with Barbra Streisand and his doomed marriage to Brooke Shields. He reveals the depression that shatters his confidence, and the mistake that nearly costs him everything. Finally, he recounts his spectacular resurrection and his march to become the oldest man ever ranked number one.
            
            In clear, taut prose, Agassi evokes his loyal brother, his wise coach, his gentle trainer, all the people who help him regain his balance and find love at last with Stefanie Graf.
            
            With its breakneck tempo and raw candor, Open will be read and cherished for years. A treat for ardent fans, it will also captivate readers who know nothing about tennis. Like Agassi's game, it sets a new standard for grace, style,

            'A must-read'---Sandeep Unnithan, managing editor, India Today

            There are not many Indian heroes whose lives have been as dramatic and adventurous as that of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. That, however, is an assessment of his life based on what is widely known about him. These often revolve around his resignation from the Indian Civil Service, joining the freedom movement, to be exiled twice for over seven years, throwing a challenge to the Gandhian leadership in the Congress, taking up an extremist position against the British Raj, evading the famed intelligence network to travel to Europe and then to Southeast Asia, forming two Governments and raising two armies and then disappearing into the unknown. All this in a span of just two decades.
            
            Now, new information throws light on Bose's intense political activities surrounding the revolutionary groups in Bengal, Punjab, Maharashtra and United Provinces, his efforts to bridge the increasing communal divide and his influence among the splintered political landscape; his outlook and relations with women; his plunge into the depths of spirituality; his penchant for covert operations and his efforts to engineer a rebellion among the Indian armed forces. With this new information, what appeared to be dramatic now becomes more intense with plots and subplots under one man's single-minded focus on freeing the motherland and envisioning its development in a new era.
            
            Furthermore, one of the most sensitive issues that have prevented political parties and successive governments from talking much about Bose is his joining the Axis camp. While Jawaharlal Nehru and other prominent Congress leaders publicly denounced the move, the Communist Party of India went on to a prolonged vilification campaign. Sardar Patel issued instruction to Congress leaders to defend the INA soldiers without eulogizing their leader.
            
            Was Bose really a Nazi sympathiser? Knowing very well about the strong public opinion that existed among the political leadership and the intelligentsia in India against Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and imperial Japan, why did he risk his own political image by allying with the Axis powers?
            
            Pacey, thought-provoking and absolutely unputdownable, Bose: The Untold Story of an Inconvenient Nationalist will open a window to many hitherto untold and unknown stories of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
            
            Probably the first critical biography of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose till date.
