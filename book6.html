                by Robert T. Kiyosaki  (Author)</h1>

                <img src="./dad.jpg" alt="" />
            </div>

            <p>
                It's been nearly 25 years since Robert Kiyosaki’s Rich Dad Poor Dad first made waves in the Personal
                Finance arena.
                It has since become the #1 Personal Finance book of all time... translated into dozens of languages and
                sold around the world.

                Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads — his real father and the father of his
                best friend, his rich dad — and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and
                investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the
                difference between working for money and having your money work for you.

                20 Years... 20/20 Hindsight
                In the 20th Anniversary Edition of this classic, Robert offers an update on what we’ve seen over the
                past 20 years related to money, investing, and the global economy. Sidebars throughout the book will
                take readers “fast forward” — from 1997 to today — as Robert assesses how the principles taught by his
                rich dad have stood the test of time.

                In many ways, the messages of Rich Dad Poor Dad, messages that were criticized and challenged two
                decades ago, are more meaningful, relevant and important today than they were 20 years ago.

                As always, readers can expect that Robert will be candid, insightful... and continue to rock more than a
                few boats in his retrospective.

                Will there be a few surprises? Count on it.

                Rich Dad Poor Dad...
                • Explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to become rich
                • Challenges the belief that your house is an asset

                about money
                • Defines once and for all an asset and a liability
                • Teaches you what to teach your kids about money for their

            Every common man who by his sheer grit and hard work achieves success should share his story with the rest for they may find inspiration and strength to go on, in his story. The 'Wings of Fire' is one such autobiography by visionary scientist Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, who from very humble beginnings rose to be the President of India. The book is full of insights, personal moments and life experiences of Dr. Kalam. It gives us an understanding on his journey of success.

Dr. Kalam by narrating his life journey evokes the reader to identify with one?s inner fire and potential, for he was of the firm belief that each one of us was born with the strength and potential to make a tangible change in the world. How he inspired himself to achieve dreams and how he went about accomplishing so much is what the book captures nicely.

The book recollects many anecdotes and stories from childhood, his time at school and college. The time spent at the Langley Research Center, NASA and Wallops Flight Facility gets a lot of attention.

Personal tragedies have not been left out. The time when he lost his father and how he felt when conferred with many awards like the Padma Bhushan have been written in much detail.

The second half of the book deals with Dr Kalam, the scientist who made a significant contribution in developing the countries guided missile program, a pioneering effort for the security of the nation. It's not with reason that he was nicknamed as the 'Missile Man of India'. The book also contains 24 photographs at various stages of his life.

            South African born Elon Musk is the renowned entrepreneur and innovator behind PayPal, SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity. Musk wants to save our planet; he wants to send citizens into space, to form a colony on Mars; he wants to make money while doing these things; and he wants us all to know about it. He is the real-life inspiration for the Iron Man series of films starring Robert Downey Junior.

The personal tale of Musk’s life comes with all the trappings one associates with a great, drama-filled story. He was a freakishly bright kid who was bullied brutally at school, and abused by his father. In the midst of these rough conditions, and the violence of apartheid South Africa, Musk still thrived academically and attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he paid his own way through school by turning his house into a club and throwing massive parties.

He started a pair of huge dot-com successes, including PayPal, which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002. Musk was forced out as CEO and so began his lost years in which he decided to go it alone and baffled friends by investing his fortune in rockets and electric cars. Meanwhile Musk’s marriage disintegrated as his technological obsessions took over his life ...

Elon Musk is the Steve Jobs of the present and the future, and for the past twelve months, he has been shadowed by tech reporter, Ashlee Vance. Elon Musk: How the Billionaire CEO of Spacex and Tesla is Shaping our Future is an important, exciting and intelligent account of the real-life Iron Man.

            Bill Gates, more commonly known as the founder of Microsoft and richest man on the planet for almost two decades, has been defined by most people by the number that represented his wealth. We will not do that here.

            We will, instead, look at the man beneath the public persona of mistaken assumptions and biased opinions to reveal what makes the man tick and what makes him do something that had never been done before.
            
            Find out if a number of the prevalent myths about him are true:
            
            Did he steal technology?
            
            Did he get arrested?
            
            What did he initially think of Warren Buffet?
            
            These and a number of lesser known facts of Bill Gates are presented here in detail with observations and analysis to help you unpack the complex life of a simple man.
            
            Once you see the life that he has led and the skills that he brought to the table, you should be able to find the same packet of ingredients within you and hopefully make your mark on this world.
            
            We look at his parents and how they influenced his career, we look at how they raised him and the kinds of trouble he got into as a kid.
            
            Bill Gates is a profound man who sees things differently and works at that with an energy that is uncommon. He is a genius by intellect and a highly focused individual who has no patience for sleep and wasting time.
            Come on in and take a look at the life of one of the world's most known individuals.

            A Washington Post Notable Book

This New York Times bestseller is a “masterful” (The Washington Post), “juicy tour of the company [Jeff] Bezos built” (The New York Times Book Review), revealing the most important business story of our time by the bestselling author of The Everything Store.

Almost ten years ago, Bloomberg journalist Brad Stone captured the rise of Amazon in his bestseller The Everything Store. Since then, Amazon has expanded exponentially, inventing novel products like Alexa and disrupting countless industries, while its workforce has quintupled in size and its valuation has soared to nearly two trillion dollars. It’s almost impossible to go a day without encountering the impact of Jeff Bezos’s Amazon, between services like Whole Foods, Prime Video, and Amazon’s cloud computing unit, AWS, plus Bezos’s ownership of The Washington Post. We live in a world run, supplied, and controlled by Amazon and its iconoclast founder.

In Amazon Unbound, Brad Stone presents an “excellent” (The New York Times), deeply reported, vividly drawn portrait of how a retail upstart became of the most powerful and feared entities in the global economy. Stone also probes the evolution of Bezos himself—who started as a geeky technologist totally devoted to building Amazon, but who transformed to become a fit, disciplined billionaire with global ambitions, who ruled Amazon with an iron fist, even as he found his personal life splashed over the tabloids.

Definitive, timely, and “engaging” (Jon Meacham, author of The Soul of America), Stone has provided an unvarnished portrait of a man and company that we couldn’t imagine modern life without.
